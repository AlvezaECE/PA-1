- Sorted and join key concepts were used in the first problem to sort characters alphabetically and to build the sorted values into a single string.
- Split was used to break the sentences into words, then I used join to rebuild the sentences after replacing words with their emoticons.
- I used python's unpacking syntax to capture different parts of the list.
